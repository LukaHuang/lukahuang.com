<p>On modern systems, passwords are actually stored in an encrypted format in a secondary file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/shadow</code>. Only those with root access can modify/read this file.</p>

<h2 id="password-encryption">Password Encryption</h2>
<p>Most Linux distributions rely on a modern password encryption algorithm called <strong>SHA-512</strong> (Secure Hashing Algorithm 512 bits), developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) to encrypt passwords.</p>

<h2 id="good-password-practices">Good Password Practices</h2>
<p>IT professionals follow several good practices for securing the data and the password of every user.</p>

<h3 id="1password-aging">1.Password aging</h3>
<p><strong>Password aging</strong> is a method to ensure that users get prompts that remind them to create a new password after a specific period. This can ensure that passwords, if cracked, will only be usable for a limited amount of time.

<h2 id="hardware-vulnerability">Hardware Vulnerability</h2>
<p><strong>When hardware is physically accessible, security can be compromised by:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Key logging: Recording the real time activity of a computer user including the keys they press. The captured data can either be stored locally or transmitted to remote machines</li>
  <li>Network sniffing: Capturing and viewing the network packet level data on your network</li>
  <li>Booting with a live or rescue disk</li>
  <li>Remounting and modifying disk content</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The guidelines of security are:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Lock down workstations and servers</li>
  <li>Protect your network links such that it cannot be accessed by people you do not trust</li>
  <li>Protect your keyboards where passwords are entered to ensure the keyboards cannot be tampered with</li>
